) High-level rule (must include everywhere)

Add a visible banner on the DataHawk page:
DEMO MODE — SYNTHETIC DATA ONLY — NOT FOR OPERATIONAL USE
Every map tile, marker popup and coordinate string must append (demo) — e.g. Lat: 12.0000 (demo).
In code put comments like: // DEMO ONLY — SYNTHETIC DATA — DO NOT USE FOR REAL OPERATIONS.

2) Visual / UX spec (make it feel like MarineTraffic + Flightradar24)

Overall style

Dark map base with subtle terrain lines. Use neon red/orange for “targets”, cyan/green for regular traffic, gray for background.

DataHawk theme: more tactical (red) accents; OSINTraX theme consistent but DataHawk darker and sharper.

Left filter panel for layers/filters, top-right badge DEMO MODE — SYNTHETIC DATA ONLY.

Map layers & controls

Base layers toggle: “Satellite (demo)”, “Tactical (demo)”, “Topographic (demo)”. (All are placeholders / synthetic.)

Time slider / playback control (like Flightradar24 replay) to animate traffic over a selected time window. Buttons: Play / Pause / Step forward / Step back / Speed x1, x2, x4.

Layer toggles: Ships, Aircraft, Hotspots, Heatmap, Anomaly Clusters.

Search box: “Find demo target (id/name)”.

Region preset buttons: Red Sea (demo), Arabian Sea (demo), Gulf (demo), Global (demo).

Markers & clusters

Ship markers: small vessel icon (triangle) or dot with heading arrow; color = navy/cyan for normal, orange for high density, red for anomaly.

Aircraft markers: small airplane icons with orientation showing heading; light-blue normal, orange for dense corridors, red for anomaly.

Implement clustering: at low zoom cluster many blips into a cluster bubble showing count; click expands.

On hover show small tooltip; on click open detail card (popup) with fields from the mock JSON.

Popups / detail card (when clicking a marker)

Header: Vessel / Aircraft — <Label> (demo)

Basic info: ID: VSL-001 (demo), Type: Cargo (demo), Last seen (demo): 2025-09-23T12:34Z, Lat/Lon: 12.0000, 45.0000 (demo), Speed (kn/kts): 13 (demo)

Short fake timeline: small list of “last 3 positions” (demo).

Buttons: View playback (demo), Flag as anomaly (demo), Close.

Always append prominent text: SIMULATED DATA — FOR DEMO ONLY.

Playback & trails

Clicking playback draws a trail polyline with fading tail and moving icon to simulate movement.

Playback speed and date/time displayed top-left of map during replay.

Trail color intensity correlates with activity level.

Heatmaps & density

Heatmap mode shows density of blips (marine traffic density or flight density). Can be toggled on/off. Use smooth, soft gradients; red = highest demo density.

Anomaly visual

When anomaly detector fires, show a pulsating red halo and a non-actionable banner:
ALERT — ANOMALY DETECTED (DEMO): Unusual concentration in Sector 7 (demo). Confidence: 68% (demo).

Popup explains: This is simulated. For real action verify with authorities.

Side panels

Left: filters (region, object type, time window, anomaly threshold).

Right: list view / table of active blips with quick action buttons (view, playback).

Bottom: timeline scrubber and small mini-map.

3) Data model — example mock JSON

Drop this into data/mock_dahawk.json. All IDs and coordinates are obviously fake/demo (rounded), and each coordinate string should include (demo) when rendered.

Notes on the mock data:

Use simple numeric rounded coords (no precise real coordinates).

Status values: normal / clustered / anomaly.

confidence_pct is fake and used only for UI display.

notes explicitly say DEMO.

4) UI strings & alerts (copy/paste)

Use these exact lines in the UI:

Top badge: DEMO MODE — SYNTHETIC DATA ONLY

Footer: NOT FOR OPERATIONAL USE

Ship tooltip: Vessel: {label} — Last seen (demo): {last_seen_demo}

Plane tooltip: Aircraft: {label} — Alt: {altitude_ft} ft (demo)

Anomaly banner title: ALERT — ANOMALY DETECTED (DEMO)

Anomaly body: Unusual concentration of simulated activity detected in Sector {sector} (demo). Confidence: {confidence}%. This dataset is synthetic for presentation only.

5) Map provider & assets recommendation (demo-safe)

Use static or synthetic tiles (exported images or AI-generated satellite-look tiles). Don’t connect to live satellite or ADS-B / AIS APIs.

If you include “satellite” layer, it must be labelled SATELLITE (SIMULATED) and use placeholders stored in public/assets/.

Use vector icons (SVG) for ships/planes and animated SVGs/CSS for movement.

6) Anomaly detection behavior (demo-only)

Anomaly detector runs on the mock dataset. Example rule: if > N blips in N-min window inside bounding box → set status anomaly.

When anomaly triggers: show the red banner, place a pulsing red halo, and write to the audit log (e.g., anomaly_demo_2025-09-23T12:34Z).

Buttons on alert: Acknowledge (demo) and View Details (demo) — details should not include any real targeting info.

7) Audit trail & access control

Every time a user opens the DataHawk map or clicks a marker, append an entry to audit_logs[] (fake user names like admin_demo) so the UI shows responsible access. Example log entry:

{
  "user": "analyst_demo",
  "action": "view_marker",
  "target_id": "VSL-003",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-23T12:35:00Z",
  "note": "DEMO view"
}

8) Presenter tips (to sell the drama but stay safe)

Start the map in “regional overview (demo)”. Zoom into hotspots using the time slider — animate traffic density rising.

When anomaly banner appears, read it aloud: “Unusual concentration detected — demo only.” Pause for dramatic effect, then open Ethics panel and emphasize simulated nature.

Ask audience: “Imagine if this were real — how would you feel?” That’s the point.
